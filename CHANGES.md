# Changes in this version

## 1. Fonts served from our own site (item 9)
- tools/fetch_fonts.py -> fixed the Fraunces entry (Google rejected it). Then: python tools/fetch_fonts.py, python build.py, commit src/fonts/.

## 2. Book text: one download source at a time (item 10)
- src/js/070-network-data.js -> TEXT_ROUTES, textRouteOrder, fetchTextRace
  - The route that worked last time is asked first and alone; the next route is added only if it fails or stays silent for 1.5 s.
  - Removed the duplicate route 'allorigins-json'.

## 3. Book text: our own small copy on Hugging Face is asked first
- src/js/070-network-data.js -> BOOK_TEXT_REPO, getHfText, one call in getGutenberg0 (before the public routes)
  - Reads rabiul43/Book_Text at texts/<id / 1000>/<id>.txt.gz; if it is not there, nothing changes.
- wordtrail_book_text_kaggle.ipynb (new, not part of the app) -> fills Book_Text from Kaggle; Telegram message every 50 books.
- tools/prep_texts.py (new) -> same file layout from a folder of .txt books on your own computer (optional).
